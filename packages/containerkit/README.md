# containerkit - Build webcontainer-based apps with ease

> Note: This is a work in progress. Don't use it yet.

Containerkit allows you to add interactive editors, terminals and more to your website through the power of [webcontainers](https://webcontainers.io/).
It provides helpers and methods to easily embedd it's functionality into your app, for example by adding code editors, terminals etc.

It works with

- Monaco editor
- Xterm JS

Currently, it is react-focused, because that's what I use. If you have the need to use this with vanilla, vue or whatever, let me know.

## A word about the license

containerkit is free, open source and fully copy-left, do whatever you want with it. Webcontainers, on the other hand, are not. Be aware of their [license, pricing and conditions](https://stackblitz.com/pricing#webcontainer-api)
